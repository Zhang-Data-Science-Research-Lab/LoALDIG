local_tvgm.m: get the local graph structure at a give time point.

refit.m: given a graph structure, refit model to reduce over-shrinkage.

cv.m: cross-validation to select hyperparameters.

sampling.m: simulate synthetic data through Gibbs sampling.

example.m: an example to demonstrate the usage of our code.
